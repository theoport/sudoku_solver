Summarise your findings here (see specification).

The easiest possible sudoku is one where each empty square has only one legal digit that 
can be placed in it. By placing a counter in the recursive functiom that increments by one
every time the recursive function is called, we can see how many legal make_move's have been
made before reaching the answer. If the program starts by placing the digit '1' in an empty square,
then mystery1 requires ~550000 calls to the recursive function and mystery3 requires ~21000 calls 
to the recursive function. If the program starts by placing the digit '9', mystery1 requires ~21000 
calls to the recursive function and mystery3 requires ~25000 calls to the recursive function.
To find the total number of legal moves (before and after the solution, if imagined on a number tree),
both these values can be added to give ~570000 possible make_move's for mystery1 and ~50000 possible 
make_move's for mystery3. 

mystery1 is extremely difficult
mystery3 is difficult
mystery2 is unsolveable
